This is a flask restful api used to control my robot's commands from outside the raspberry.
The robot commands setup so far are the following:
1- directions (left, right, forward, backwards)
2- LED (turning the fron or back leds on and off )
3- Temperature - Pressure - Humidity measurments.
4- Ultrasonic to measure the distance between any object and the robot.
